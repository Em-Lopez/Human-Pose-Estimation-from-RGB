# Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera - The repo
In recent years, tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera, which is an interdisciplinary field that fuses computer vision, deep/machine learning and anatomy. This repo is for my study notes and will be used as a place for triaging new research papers.

SO CHECK IT, I want like a off the shelf state-of-the-art 2d pose heatmap detector, with FBI polarity switches on the joints, hear? I want like a recurrent neural network that does video frame extrapolation. I want a generator network that gives me a bunch of funky poses and a discriminator that throws 'em, and a thing that runs on physics, like actual physics!
