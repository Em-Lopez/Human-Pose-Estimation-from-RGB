### Fall 2018

<b>:camera::one::package:[Deep 3D Human Pose Estimation Under Partial Body Presence](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8451031) </b> (Oct 2018)
###### My legs have been chopped off, and my head, but tis but a scratch.

<b>:camera::one::package:[3D Human Pose Estimation Using Stochastic Optimization In Real Time](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8451427) </b> (Oct 2018)
###### Try again and again, till you get it right. Uses depth based sensors. RTW + Particle Swarms

<b>:camera::one::package:[Adversarial 3D Human Pose Estimation via Multimodal Depth Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07921v1.pdf) </b> (Sep 2018)
###### Continuation of FBI work, also got multimodal network now. IDK What that means

<b>:camera::one::door:[Deeply Learned Compositional Models for Human Pose Estimation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Wei_Tang_Deeply_Learned_Compositional_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)</b> (Sep 2018)
###### Take the human bode, and shove it into code blocks
